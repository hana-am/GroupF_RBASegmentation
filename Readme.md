# **Name Project**

## **About**

`RiskEvaluation`, is a Python package for creating a Risk Based Analysis Model. This package is based on customer segmentation, which involves categorizing the portfolio by industry, location, revenue, account size, and number of employees and many other variables to reveal where risk and opportunity live within the portfolio. Those patterns can then provide key measurable data points for more predictive credit risk management. Taking a portfolio approach to risk management gives credit professionals a better fix on the accounts, in order to develop strategies for better serving segments that present the best opportunities. Not only that, you can work to maximize performance in all customer segments, even seemingly risky segments.
Customer segmentation analysis can lead to several tangible improvements in credit risk management: stronger credit policies, and improved internal communication and cooperation across teams. 

## **How To**
`RiskEvaluation` package its comprehended by a Class which perform the following actions:

1. Data Cleaning.
1. Duplicate removal, using a feature set by the user as pivot value.
1. Set our target as a binary variable.
1. Creating new features in order to obtain a better insight from the dataset such as:
	- [x] Age
	- [x] Days lapsed
	- [x] Percentage of down payment
	- [x] Income
1. Create a segmentation for categorical variables.
1. Create a segmentation for numerical variables.
1. Compare the accuracy of a logistic regression model with a full dataset vs. the segmented dataset.
1. Report generation in order to indicate which features are better to analyze with the segmented dataset or with the whole dataset.
